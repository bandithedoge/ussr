# User-friendly Songsterr Simple Receiver

It literally just downloads the current tab in `.gp5` format and nothing else. Written in CoffeeScript because I hate vanilla JS.

## Usage

1. Install a userscript addon ([Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/) strongly recommended).
2. Install this userscript.
3. Open your favorite song on Songsterr and click the coconut doggy.
4. ???
5. Profit!

## Notes

- **You need to refresh (`F5`) the page after picking a song.** I'm too damn lazy to fix this.
- It will only download the latest revision. I'm also too damn lazy to fix this.

## Building

```sh
yarn prepare
```
