# User-friendly Songsterr Simple Receiver

It literally just downloads the current tab in `.gp5` format and nothing else. Written in CoffeeScript because I hate vanilla JS.

## Usage

1. Install a userscript addon ([Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/) strongly recommended).
2. [Install this userscript](https://github.com/bandithedoge/ussr/raw/master/dist/ussr.user.js).
3. Open your favorite song on Songsterr and click the coconut doggy.
4. ???
5. Profit!

## Notes

-   It will only download the latest revision. I'm too damn lazy to fix this.

## Building

```sh
git clone https://github.com/bandithedoge/ussr.git
cd ussr

yarn
```
